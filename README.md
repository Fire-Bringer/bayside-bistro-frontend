I've created a README.md file for the Bayside Bistro project. This README includes standard sections like overview, features, technology stack, installation instructions, project structure, contribution guidelines, licensing information, and contact details.

Since I don't have access to the actual package.json file, I've made some assumptions about the project based on the workspace name. You may want to update specific details like:

1. The actual GitHub repository URL
2. Specific dependencies and versions from your package.json
3. Any custom scripts defined in your package.json
4. The correct license that your project uses
5. Accurate contact information
